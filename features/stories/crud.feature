Feature: The Create, Read, Update and Delete API

    The CRUD API allows us to list, create, read, update and delete
    Owners, Cats and Dogs.

Background:
    Given a web application
    And a client with a valid authentication token

Scenario Outline: We can create Owners, Cats and Dogs
    When I POST {"name":"<name>"} to the /<type>
    Then a <type> has been created called <name>
    And I receive an id
    
    Examples: names and types
    | name   | type    |
    | test   | owners  |
    | test   | cats    |
    | bob    | dogs    |
    | bob    | owners  |
    | alice  | cats    |
    | alice  | dogs    |

Scenario Outline: The create API rejects invalid names
    When I POST {"name":"<name>"} to the /<type>
    Then I receive a 400 status

    Examples: names and types
    | name | type   |
    | $ %' | owners |
    | $ %' | cats   |
    | $ %' | dogs   |
    | &()- | owners |
    | &()- | cats   |
    | &()- | dogs   |

Scenario Outline: The API rejects requests that do not contain the correct parameters
    When I POST {} to the /<type>
    Then I receive a 400 status

    Examples: Types
    | type   |
    | owners |
    | cats   |
    | dogs   |

Scenario Outline: The create API rejects duplicate names
    When I POST {"name":"<name>"} to the /<type>
    Then a <type> has been created called <name>
    And I receive an id
    When I POST {"name":"<name>"} to the /<type>
    Then I receive a 409 status
    And the error Name exists is returned
    
    Examples: names and types
    | name | type    |
    | test | owners  |
    | test | cats    |
    | test | dogs    |
    | bob  | owners  |
    | bob  | cats    |
    | bob  | dogs    |

Scenario Outline: We can list Owners, Cats and Dogs
    Given <type> contains ["alice", "bob", "charlotte"]
    When I GET /<type>
    Then I receive a 200 status
    And a list of names containing ["alice", "bob", "charlotte"] is returned

    Examples: Types
    | type   |
    | owners |
    | cats   |
    | dogs   |

Scenario Outline: We can create, read, update and delete Owners, Cats and Dogs
    When I POST {"name":"<name>"} to the /<type>
    And I receive an id
    And I GET /<type>/id with the id
    Then the object returned has a name of <name>
    When I PUT {"name": "<new_name>"} to the /<type>/id with the id
    And I GET /<type>/id with the id
    Then the object returned has a name of <new_name>
    When I DELETE /<type>/id with the id
    Then I receive a 202 status
    When I GET /<type>/id with the id
    Then I receive a 404 status

    Examples: names and types
    | name | type    | new_name  |

    When I POST {"name":"<name>"} to the /<type>
    And I receive an id
    And I GET /<type>/id with the id
    Then the object returned has a name of <name>
    And the object returned has a position of 0 x 0
    When I PUT {"name": "<new_name>", "x": 7, "y": 11} to the /<type>/id/position with the id
    And I GET /<type>/id with the id
    Then the object returned has a name of <new_name>

    When I POST {"name":"<owner>"} to the /owners
    And I receive an owner id
    And I POST {"name":"<pet>"} to the /<type>
    And I receive a pet id
    And I POST to the /owner/%d/pet/%d with the ids
    Then I receive a 201 status
    When I DELETE /owner/%d/pet/%d with the ids
    Then I receive a 202 status
    When I DELETE /owner/%d/pet/%d with the ids
